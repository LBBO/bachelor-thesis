The ABSTRACT is to be a fully-justified text following the title page. The text will be formatted in 12\,pt, single-spaced Computer Modern. The title is ``Abstract'', set in 12\,pt Computer Modern Sans Serif, centered, boldface type, and initially capitalized. Writing the abstract in English is mandatory even if the thesis itself is written in German. The length of the abstract should be roughly about 200 words but must not exceed 250 words.

As usual, the abstract should clearly summarize the aim, the background and the results of your thesis so that an interested reading can decide if he or she wants to further read your (interesting) written report. Also, the abstract should be kept simple. That is, do not include tables, figures or cross references in the abstract. You will have plenty of time in your thesis to explain things more clearly.
